    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
  Welcome to my creative portfolio!
  <br> I am a Computational-Media major at Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Media and Interactive Design. This site has been created to present a culmination of my personal and professional interests.
  <br><br> This forces a line break.
  <br> This tag doesn't need to be closed.
  
  <p> Starts a paragraph. Close like so: </p>
  
  <p> Then repeat to start the next paragraph, and pay attention to the line spacing that results from this technique. </p>
  
  <p> Are you getting the hang of this? It is quite a challenge to position text accurately with these basic techniques - not like word processing at all. Later on you can learn how to draw TABLES - a grid which enables the precise setting of web page elements - but, for now, see how much you can do with a few simple tricks. </p>
  
  <center>puts text in the centre of a page. Close</center> 
  <pre>
  
      This enables you to have some control
      over the positioning of text.
      BUT
      the font, as you see, is mono-type.
  
      Remember 
      to
                      close
                             the
                tag.
  </pre>
   
  
  Don't forget - there is no space between the brackets and the text inside.
  
  and just for fun: < HR > draws a horizonal line across the page. No need to close this tag.
